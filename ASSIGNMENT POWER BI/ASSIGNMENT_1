1. What do you mean by BI? Explain.

BI, or Business Intelligence, refers to the strategies, technologies, and tools used by companies to analyze valuable business data beyond traditional reporting.
It involves bringing together all types of information a company has in a way that's relevant to a specific question or opportunity. 
By transforming raw data into usable information, BI provides detailed intelligence about the nature of the business, 
allowing for fact-based decision making using historical data rather than assumptions and gut feeling.

The process of BI typically involves extracting raw data from corporate databases, cleaning and transforming the data into a usable format, 
and then performing data analysis to create reports, summaries, dashboards, maps, graphs, and charts. 
These visualizations provide users with a detailed understanding of the business and support strategic,
tactical, and operational business decisions.

BI platforms are increasingly being used as front-end interfaces for big data systems, enabling a broad range of users to access and analyze diverse data stored in them. 
This helps organizations to make smarter decisions based on all of the relevant information available to them.

In short, BI is the mechanism by which companies can provide credible and valuable answers to business-related questions and opportunities,
helping to inform decision making and drive profitable business actions.
