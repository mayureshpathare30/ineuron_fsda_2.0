1. Explain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBi with an example?

Business intelligence (BI) is a set of strategies technologies that organizations use to analyze business information and transform it intoable insights to inform strategic and tactical business decisions.
BI tools access and analyze data sets, presenting analytical findings in reports, summaries, dashboards, graphs, charts, and maps to provide users with detailed intelligence about the state of business. 
The term BI often also refers to a range of tools that provide quick, easy-to-digest access to insights about an organization’s current state, based on available data.
Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that delivers insights throughout your organization. It allows analysts to connect to hundreds of data sources, 
simplify data prep, and drive ad hoc analysis. Power BI enables analysts to produce beautiful reports, which can be published and shared with colleagues on any device. 
With Power BI, organizations can quickly access critical data, set up dashboards, and track key performance indicators (KPIs) in real time, allowing for informed decision-making.
Descriptive analytics is the process of identifying trends and relationships in data using historical and current data. 
It involves understanding what has happened in the past and is used to quantify and understand trends in the data.
Descriptive analytics is often performed using data aggregation and data mining techniques, and it helps organizations to gain insights from their data, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.
Predictive analytics is a form of advanced analytics that uses both new and historical data to forecast future activity, behavior, and trends.
It involves applying statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to data sets to create predictive models that answer the question “what is likely to happen?”
Predictive analytics can be used to identify risks and opportunities, optimize operations, and improve customer experiences.
Prescriptive analytics is a form of advanced analytics that provides recommendations on what actions to take.
It goes beyond predictive analytics by suggesting various courses of action and their potential outcomes. 
Prescriptive analytics uses optimization algorithms, machine learning, and computational modeling to identify the best course of action,
enabling organizations to make informed decisions and take optimal actions in real time.

Five real-life questions that BI and analytics can help answer are:
What were our sales figures for the last quarter, and how do they compare to the same quarter last year? (Descriptive analytics)
What are the projected sales figures for the next quarter based on historical trends and current market conditions? (Predictive analytics)
Which products or services are driving the most revenue and profit, and how can we optimize our product mix to increase revenue and profit? (Descriptive and Prescriptive analytics)
What factors are contributing to customer churn, and how can we identify at-risk customers to proactively address their concerns and reduce churn? (Predictive and Prescriptive analytics)
Which marketing channels are most effective in driving conversions and revenue, and how can we optimize our marketing spend to maximize ROI? (Descriptive and Predictive analytics)

2.Explain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?

Business Intelligence (BI) is a set of strategies and technologies that enterprises use to analyze business information and transform it into actionable insights to inform strategic and tactical business decisions.
BI tools access and analyze data sets and present analytical findings in reports, summaries, dashboards, graphs, charts, and maps to provide users with detailed intelligence about the state of the business.
The term BI often also refers to a range of tools that provide quick, easy-to-digest access to insights about an organization’s current state, based on available data.
Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that delivers insights throughout your organization.
It allows you to connect to your data sources, simplify data prep, and drive ad hoc analysis.
Power BI enables self-service BI, where users can create their reports and dashboards by themselves, without having to depend on IT. 
It provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards. 
Power BI assists analysts by providing a comprehensive set of tools to connect, prepare, model, analyze, visualize, and share data.
Descriptive analytics is the process of identifying trends and relationships in data using historical and current data.
It provides a summary of what has happened in the past and is used to understand the current state of the business, such as sales trends, customer behavior, and market trends.
Descriptive analytics helps organizations to answer questions like "What are the sales figures for the last quarter?" or "What is the average customer spend?"
Predictive analytics is a form of advanced analytics that uses both new and historical data to forecast future activity, behavior, and trends. 
It involves applying statistical analysis techniques, analytical queries, and automated machine learning algorithms to data sets to create predictive models that place a numerical value, or score, on the likelihood of a particular event happening. 
Predictive analytics helps organizations to answer questions like "What is the likelihood of a customer churning?" or "What will be the sales for the next quarter?"
I believe there is a typo in your question, and you meant to ask about "prescriptive analytics" instead of "perspective analytics." Prescriptive analytics is the final phase of business analytics,
where the focus is on finding the best course of action to achieve specific goals. It combines optimization, simulation, and decision-making algorithms to suggest actions and decisions based on the insights gained from descriptive and predictive analytics. 
Prescriptive analytics helps organizations to answer questions like "What should we do to increase sales?" or "Which product should we promote to which customer segment?"

Here are five real-life examples of questions that Power BI can answer:

What are the sales figures for each product category in the last quarter?
Which regions have the highest customer satisfaction scores?
What is the average revenue per user (ARPU) for each subscription plan?
Which sales representatives have the highest conversion rates?
How many open support tickets do we have, and what is the average time to resolution?
