2.What limitations of Excel, Microsoft solved by PowerBi?

 Microsoft addressed several limitations of Excel with PowerBI, including:

Data size limitation: Excel has a limit of just over 1 million rows and 16 thousand columns, while PowerBI does not have such restrictions and can handle millions of rows of data.
PowerBI Service has a 1 GB dataset limit, but PowerBI Premium capacity is available for larger datasets.
Publishing and sharing reports: Excel does not offer a cloud-based publishing service to share reports, datasets, and dashboards. 
PowerBI, on the other hand, allows for publishing reports to the PowerBI Service and sharing them with others.
Complexity and components: PowerBI has a more complex structure than Excel, with various components such as PowerBI Desktop, PowerBI Gateway, and PowerBI Services. 
This complexity can be a limitation for users who are not familiar with these components.
End-user usability: PowerBI can be challenging to use for business users who are not Microsoft Excel power users, as it was designed in a more complex manner.
It is important to note that PowerBI is a more powerful tool than Excel in many scenarios, but it may not be the best tool for all use cases. 
The choice between PowerBI and Excel will depend on the specific needs and resources of the organization and its users.

5.How powerBi eliminated the need to host SharePoint Server on premises?

Power BI Report Server does not eliminate the need for hostingPoint Server on-premises. Instead, Power BI Report Server you to connect to and access data stored in SharePoint Server,
which can be hosted either on-premises or in the cloud. This means that if you have an existing SharePoint Server installation on-premises,
you can use PowerI Report Server to and publish Power BI reports that can access and visualize data stored in SharePoint. However,
the Power BI Report Server itself still needs to be installed and hosted on-premises.

Additionally, if you are using SharePoint Online in the cloud, you can still connect to and access data stored in SharePoint Online using Power BI Report Server.
In this case, you would need to use the appropriate authentication method, such as Office 365 or Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, to connect to SharePoint Online.

In summary, Power BI Report Server does not eliminate the need for hosting SharePoint Server on-premises, but it does allow you to connect to and access data stored in SharePoint Server, 
whether it is hosted on-premises or in the cloud.

6.Explain the updates done in Power Bi Service(power BI 2.0) as compared to older version ?

 Power BI has not completely eliminated the need for-premises SharePoint as there are still use cases for on-premises.
However, PowerI has introduced various features and capabilities to provide a comprehensive and integrated BI experience, 
which can reduce the dependency on on-premises solutions in certain scenarios.

Power BI offers two hosting options: Power BI Service and Power BI Report Server. Power BI Service is a cloud-based solution,
while Power BI Report Server is an on-premises solution. The choice between these options depends on the organization's requirements and preferences.

Power BI Report Server can be a cost-effective and viable solution for on-premises BI needs, especially when a significant portion of the users will only consume reports. 
Power BI Pro licenses can be assigned to the users who will create and deploy reports, while the consumers can access the reports without a Pro license.

For hybrid scenarios, where both on-premises and cloud-based solutions are utilized, 
Power BI Service can offer modern features and capabilities that can complement the on-premises solutions.
Power BI Premium might be expensive for small to medium-sized organizations; however, it can provide advanced sharing, 
collaboration, and performance features for large enterprises. Power BI Pro licenses can still be used in conjunction with Premium capacities for specific user roles and scenarios.

In summary, Power BI has not entirely eliminated the need for on-premises SharePoint, but it has introduced various features and hosting options to cater to diverse BI requirements.
The choice between on-premises and cloud-based solutions depends on the organization's specific needs, budget, and preferences.
