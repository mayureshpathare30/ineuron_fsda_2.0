1.Explain DAX.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions is a formula language used in Power B, Analysis Services, and Power Pivot in Excel for data analysis and calculation. 
It is made up of expressions, operators, and constants that perform advanced calculations and queries on in related tables and columns in tabular data models.

DAX formulas are used in measures, calculated columns, tables, and row-level security.asures are dynamic calculation formulas where the results change depending on context, 
while calculated columns are created by using a DAX formula to derive a new column based on an existing column in the table.

The basic syntax of DAX is similar to Excel formulas, with additional functions and operators specific to Power BI.
The three fundamental concepts of DAX are tables, columns, and measures. Tables store data, columns describe the attributes of the data, and measures perform calculations on the data.
These concepts form the foundation of DAX and are used to create complex data models and analyses in Power BI.

To write DAX for Power BI, you need to create a new calculated column or measure in the table or visual and enter the DAX formula in the formula bar. 
Power BI provides an easy way to see the list of all functions, and when you start typing your function in the formula bar, 
you can see the list of all functions starting with that alphabet.

DAX has various function types to analyze data and create new columns and measures, including functions from different categories such as mathematical,text, logical, date and time, 
and more. The use of some DAX functions may have limitations in measures and calculated columns, and some functions are deprecated and not recommended for use.

2.Explain datasets, reports, and dashboards and how they relate to each other?
In data analysis, datasets are the raw or processed data that is used for generating insights.
Reports and dashboards are two different ways of presenting and visualizing the data from one or multiple datasets to communicate insights and facilitate decision-making.

A report is a more detailed and comprehensive presentation of data, often including tables, charts, and text that provide a thorough analysis of a specific topic or question. 
Reports can be used to provide a snapshot of data at a specific point in time or to document the results of an in-depth analysis.
Reports can be used to communicate the findings of a data analysis project to stakeholders, or to provide a detailed overview of a particular aspect of a business or organization.

A dashboard, on the other hand, is a visual representation of key metrics and data that is designed to provide a quick and easy-to-understand overview of a specific topic or question.
Dashboards typically include a small number of charts and visualizations that are carefully selected to provide a high-level view of the data.
Dashboards are often used to monitor the performance of a business or organization in real-time, or to provide a quick overview of key metrics to decision-makers.

In summary, datasets are the raw or processed data that is used for generating insights, while reports and dashboards are two different ways of presenting and 
visualizing the data from one or multiple datasets to communicate insights and facilitate decision-making. 
Reports are more detailed and comprehensive, while dashboards are designed to provide a quick and easy-to-understand overview of key metrics and data.

3.How reports can be created in power BI, explain two ways with Navigation of each.

I can explain two ways to create reports in Power BI with navigation of each.

Using Power BI Des: Power BI Desktop is a powerful tool that allows you to create reports with dynamic perspectives and insights into your data. Here are the steps to create a using Power BI Desktop:
a. Download and install Power BI Desktop on your computer.

b. Open Power BI Desktop and click on "Get Data" to connect to your data source. You can connect to a variety of data sources, including Excel, CSV, SQL Server, and more.

c. Once you have connected to your data source, you can start creating your report by adding visualizations to the report canvas. 
You can add tables, charts, graphs, and other visualizations to your report.

d. To navigate between pages in your report, you can use the page navigation buttons at the bottom of the report canvas.
You can also use the "New Page" button to add new pages to your report.

e. Once you have finished creating your report, you can publish it to the Power BI service to share it with others.

Using Power BI Service: Power BI Service is a web-based version of Power BI that allows you to create reports and dashboards in the cloud.
Here are the steps to create a report using Power BI Service:
a. Go to the Power BI Service website and sign in with your Microsoft account.

b. Click on "Create" and select "Report" to start creating a new report.

To connect to data in Power BI, can use the built-in features or the Google Analytics content pack. Here are the steps for each method:

Method 1: Built-in features

Open Power BI and click on "Get Data" in the Home ribbon. . In the "Get Data window, you can search for the data source you want to connect to select it from the list of categories on the left.
Once you have selected the data source, click on "Connect" to proceed.
You will be prompted to enter your credentials for the data source and grant permission to Power BI to access it.
After you have successfully connected, you can choose the tables you want to import and click on "Load" to bring the data into Power BI.
Method 2: Google Analytics content pack

Open Power BI and click on "Get Data" in the Home ribbon.
In the "Get Data" window, search for "Google Analytics" or select it from the list of data sources.
Click on "Google Analytics" to open the content pack.
Enter your Google Analytics account information and click on "Sign In".
Select the property and view you want to connect to and click on "Next".
Power BI will then create a dashboard, report, and dataset based on your Google Analytics data.
You can customize the dashboard and report to fit your needs and explore your data using the built-in features of Power BI.

6.In Power BI visualization, what are Reading View and Editing view?

The difference between Reading View anditing View in PowerI visualization.

Reading View is default view in Power BI and is intended for report consumers who only need to view and interact with the report.
Reading View, users can explore the report, interact with visualizations, and filter data. However, they cannot make any changes to the report.

Editing View, on the other hand, is intended for report owners and creators who need to modify the report. 
In Editing View, users have access to additional features and tools that allow them to make changes to the report, such as adding or removing visualizations, 
changing the layout, and modifying the data model. Editing View also allows users to access the Fields, Filters, and Visualizations panes, 
which provide additional options for customizing the report.

To access Editing View, users must have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license and be a report owner or creator,
or have at least a Contributor role in the workspace that houses the report.

In summary, Reading View is intended for report consumers who only need to view and interact with the report,
while Editing View is intended for report owners and creators who need to modify the report.
