                                                                                   Python Assignment-1

1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
&#39;hello&#39;
-87.8
-
/
+
6

"hello" - This is a string value.
-87.8 - This is a numeric value.
This is a mathematical operator.
/ - This is a mathematical operator.
This is a mathematical operator.
6 - This is a numeric value.

let arr = [
    "hello",
    -87.8,
    -,
    /,
    +,
    6
];

In the context of programming, a value can be any data type such as numbers, strings, objects, or even functions. In the provided array, each element represents a value.

An expression is a combination of one or more values and operators. In the given array, elements 3, 4, and 5 are mathematical operators. 
These operators are used to perform operations on the numeric values provided in the array.

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

A string is a type of value that can stored in a variable A variable is a name that can refer to any value, while a string is a value representing text. Quotes, 
either double or single, are used to create string literals, indicating that the text enclosed is not code, but a value.
Regular variables in Python are actually objects, and all values are indeed objects.
The difference is that a variable is a name that refers to a value, while a string is a specific type of value that represents text.

3. Describe three different data types.

Three different data types other than string and variable number, date, and Boolean.
The number data type is used for any data that is numeric or should be worked with as a number for addition or other math operations.
The date data type is used for that is a date or time, such as a birthday. The Boolean data type is used for data that only has the value true or false.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

In programming, an expression is a combination of operators, constants, and variables that the programming language interprets to produce a value. 
Expressions can be made up of one or more operands and zero or more operators. operands are the elements on which the operators perform operations.

Expressions can be of different types, including arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment expressions. Arithmetic expressions involve mathematical operations,
relational expressions compare values, logical expressions evaluate to true or false, bitwise expressions perform bit-level operations,
and assignment expressions assign values to variables.

Expressions are essential in programming as they allow you to perform calculations, make decisions, and manipulate data.
Understanding how expressions work and how to write them is crucial for writing effective and efficient code.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

The difference between an expression and a statement:

A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute Examples of statements include assignment statements, while statements, for statements,
if statements, and import statements.
expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. Examples of expressions include numerical literals (e.g. 5),
variables (e.g. x), and function calls (e.g. len("hello")).
In the example provided, spam = 10 is an assignment statement, which is a type of statement. The expression being assigned is the integer literal 10. 
The statement itself does not have a value, but the expression being assigned does (10).

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

To illustrate this, consider the following Python code:

bacon = 22
bacon + 1
print(bacon)

The output of this code will be:

22

This shows that the variable bacon still contains the value 22 after the operation bacon + 1.

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
&#39;spam&#39; + &#39;spamspam&#39;
&#39;spam&#39; * 3

 The values of the following two would be:

'spam' + 'spamspam' = spamspamspam

'spam' * 3 = spamspamspam

This is because the first term is concatenating the string "spam" with the string "spamspam", resulting in "spamspamspam".
The second term is repeating the string "spam" 3 times, also resulting in "spamspamspam".

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

In Python, variable names can only be one word, can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore character, and cannot begin with a number. 
Therefore, 'eggs' is a valid variable name because it is one word, made up of letters, does not begin with a number.
The other hand,100' is not a valid variable name because begins with a number.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------9----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

The three functions to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a in Python are int(), float(), and str().

The int() functionts a number or a string containing a number to an integer. For example:

num = 3.7
integer_num = int(num)
print(integer_num)  # Output: 3

The float() function converts a number or a string containing a number to a floating-point number. For example:

num = 5
floating_num = float(num)
print(floating_num)  # Output: 5.0

The str() function converts a number or a string containing a number to a string. For example:

num = 10
string_num = str(num)
print(string_num)  # Output: '10'

These functions can also convert strings that contain numbers to integers, floating-point numbers, or strings. For example:

string_num = '123'
integer_num = int(string_num)
print(integer_num)  # Output: 123

string_num = '4.56'
floating_num = float(string_num)
print(floating_num)  # Output: 4.56

string_num = '789'
string_string_num = str(string_num)
print(string_string_num)  # Output: '789'

Note that if the string cannot be converted to a number, the int() and float() functions will raise a ValueError exception. For example:

string_num = 'hello'
integer_num = int(string_num)  # Raises ValueError

string_num = 'hello'
if string_num.isdigit():
    integer_num = int(string_num)
else:
    print('Error: string contains non-digit characters')

This will print an error message instead of raising a ValueError exception.

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
&#39;I have eaten &#39; + 99 + &#39; burritos.&#39;

The expression 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' causes an error in Python because you cannot concatenate a string and an integer using the + operator. 
To fix this, you can convert the integer to a string using the str() function, like this: 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.
This will concatenate the three strings together to form the desired sentence.
