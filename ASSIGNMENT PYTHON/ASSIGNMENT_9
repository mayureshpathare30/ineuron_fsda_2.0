1. To what does a relative path refer?

A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory. It makes use of special symbols such as a dot (.) and a double dot (..),
which translate into the current directory and the parent directory, respectively. Double dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy, while a single dot represents the current directory. 
A relative path cannot span disk drives,meaning that if the root directory is on one drive, you cannot use relative paths to navigate to a directory on another drive.

2. What does an absolute path start with your operating system?

In a given operating system, an absolute path starts with the root directory which is represented by a forward slash (/). 
The root directory is the-level directory of file system, and absolute paths always start with the root and provide the full path to file or directory.
Example, the absolute path to the home directory of a user named "waas" would be "/home/waqas".

3. What do the functions os.getcwd() and os.chdir() do?

The function os.getcwd() returns the current working directory the Python interpreter in your operating system, 
while the function os.chdir()changes the current working directory the path specified as its argument. 
These functions are part of the os module in Python, which provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

4. What are the . and .. folders?

The '.' folder represents the current directory, while the '..' folder represents the parent directory in a file system.
They are useful shortcuts for navigating the file hierarchy and are often used in relative path specifications.

5. In C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt, which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?

C:\bacon\eggs is the directory name, and spam.txt is the base name.

6. What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?

The three "mode" arguments that can be passed to the open() function arer" for reading, "w" for writing, and "a" for appending.

7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?

If an existing file is opened write mode ("w"), any existing content in the file will be truncated (cleared), and new data can be written to the.
This behavior can be a problem if you want to preserve the existing content of the file, as it will be deleted immediately upon opening the file in write mode. 
To avoid overwriting existing files, you can use the "a" (append) mode instead, which adds new data to the end of the file without deleting any existing content. 
Alternatively, you can use the "x" (exclusive create) mode, which creates a new file only if it doesn't already exist, and returns an error if the file does exist.

8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?

When opening an existing file in write ("w") using the open() function both the read() and readlines() methods will not be available, as they are used for reading from a file, 
not writing. Instead, you can use the write() or writelines() methods to write data to the file. you attempt to use read() or readlines() on a file opened in write mode, 
you will get an "io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable" error. It's important to note that opening a file in write mode will truncate (empty) the file, 
so use caution when opening existing files in this mode.

9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?

A shelf value resembles a dictionary; it has keys and values, along with keys() and values() methods work similarly to the dictionary methods of the same.
