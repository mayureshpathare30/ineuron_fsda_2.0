the excel worksheet?
The different margin options available in Excel are, Wide, Narrow, and Custom.

2. Set a background for your table created.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to set background for a specific table or range of cells in Excel. 
The Background function in Excel allows you to insert an image as a background the entire worksheet, which will be tiled and may not look good.

As a workaround, can insert a new shape into the sheet and it up with a picture, defining it as "Picture or texture fill".
However, this will not allow you to click, edit, or select cells within the range with your mouse.

If you want to highlight text or numbers in a specific range to make the data more visible, you can change the font color or add a background color to the cell or range of cells. 
To do this, select the cell or range of cells for which you want to add a fill color, and then click the "Fill Color" button on the Home tab and pick the color you want.

Alternatively, you can use Conditional Formatting to highlight cells based on their values. 
For example, you can use the "Highlight Cell Rules" option to highlight cells that are equal to a specific value or within a certain range of values.

If you want to insert a watermark into your worksheet, you can use the "Insert Watermark" option in Kutools for Excel. 
This will allow you to insert a picture or text as a watermark, which will be placed behind the data cells.

Overall, while it is not possible to set a background for a specific table in Excel, there are several other options available for highlighting and formatting data in a worksheet.
