keep in mind that Excel will not display any value in the cell until you enter a number and apply the percentage format.

If you want to convert a number to a percentage as you type, you can use the following steps:

Select the cell where you want to enter the percentage.
Type the number you want to convert to a percentage followed by the percent sign (e.g. "0.2%").
Press Enter.
Excel will automatically apply the percentage format to the cell and display the number as a percentage.

It's also worth noting that you can use keyboard shortcuts to apply the percentage format.

To increase the number of decimal places displayed in the selected cells, you can press "Ctrl + Shift + ,",

6. How do you use text commands in Excel?
To convert a time field in Excel to a time range of 17:00-17:59 using the numbers in the time field, you can use the following formula:

=TEXT(INT(A2/60)&":"&MOD(A2,60),"17:00-17:59")

This formula extracts the hour and minutes from the time field in cell A2, converts the hour to an integer, and then formats the result as a time range of 17:00-17:59.

Here's how the formula works:

INT(A2/60) extracts the hour from the time field in cell A2 and converts it to an integer.
MOD(A2,60) extracts the minutes from the time field in cell A2.
& is used to concatenate (or join) the hour and minutes together with a colon (:) between them.
TEXT(result,"17:00-17:59") formats the result as a time range of 17:00-17:59.
You can copy this formula to other cells in the same column to apply it to a range of time fields.

For example, if you have time fields in cells A2 to A10, you can use the following formula in cell B2 and then copy it to cells B3 to B10:

=TEXT(INT(A2:A10/60)&":"&MOD(A2:A10,60),"17:00-17:59")

This formula uses an array of time fields in cells A2 to A10 and applies the formula to each time field in the array.

Note that when using an array formula, you need to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter instead of just Enter to enter the formula. 
This will insert curly braces ({}) around the formula, indicating that it is an array formula.
