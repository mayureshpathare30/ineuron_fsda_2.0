OCW, or OpenCourseWare, refers to course lessons that are created at universities and published for free via the Internet.
The OCW movement started in 1999 in Germany and gained traction in Europe and the United States before spreading worldwide.
MIT OpenCourseWare, launched in 2002, was a major contributor to the movement and has inspired other universities to create their own OCW platforms.

OCW projects typically include video lectures, notes, exams, and other course materials that are available for anyone to access and use. 
The goal of OCW is to enhance human learning worldwide by making educational content freely available.

In Japan, the OCW movement has been gaining popularity, with universities such as the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University creating their own OCW platforms.
However, due to a lack of experts in content production, many Japanese universities have had to outsource the production of OCW.

OCW platforms offer a variety of courses across different fields, including Africana Studies, Energy Entrepreneurship, Environment & Sustainability, Introductory Programming,
MIT Open Learning Library, and Transportation. Some OCW platforms, such as edX, also offer the possibility of earning academic credit or certificates based on supervised examinations.

Overall, OCW provides a valuable resource for learners around the world, offering free access to high-quality educational content from top universities.
