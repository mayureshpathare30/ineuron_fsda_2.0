3. Is there a need to change the height and width in a cell? Why?
The text in the provided context discusses how to modify the height and width of rows and columns in an Excel worksheet, 
but it does not explicitly state why it is necessary to change height and width of cell.
However, there are several reasons why a user might want to change height and width of cell:

To fit the content: If the content of a cell is too long to fit within the default cell width,
the user can increase the width of the cell to display the entire content. Similarly, if the content of a cell is too tall to fit within the default cell height,
the user can increase the height of the cell.
To improve readability: Increasing the height and width of a cell can make the content more readable by providing more space around the text.
To create a specific layout: Changing the height and width of cells can help the user create a specific layout for their worksheet.
For example, they might want to create a title heading by merging several cells together.
No, this question is not a duplicate of the previous one. 
The previous question asked about the purpose of changing the height and width of rows and columns, 
while this question asks about the purpose of changing the height and width of a cell. Although the concepts are related, they are not the same.

4. What is the keyboard shortcut to unhide rows?
The keyboard shortcut tohide columns in Excel is:

you select the column range in which the cells are located and use the same shortcut.

5. How to hide rows containing blank cells?
To hide rows where the last 8 columns contain no blank cells, you use the following steps:

Select the entire range of data that you want to the filter to.
Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and click on "Filter". This will add drop-down arrows to each column header.
Click on the drop-down arrow for the column that contains the blank cells you want to filter.
At the bottom of the drop-down list, click on "Text Filters" or "Number Filters" (depending on the type of data in the column), then select "Does Not Equal".
In the box that appears, enter a value that is not in the column (for example, if the column contains only numbers, you can enter a text value like "XXX"). 
This will effectively filter out all rows that contain blank cells in that column.
Repeat steps 3-5 for each of the last 8 columns.
This will filter out all rows where any of the last 8 columns contain blank cells. 
If you want to show all rows again, simply click on the "Clear" button in the "Sort & Filter" group on the "Data" tab.

excel?
To hide rows containing blank cells in Excel, you can follow these steps:

Navigate to Conditional Formatting on the Home ribbon tab, select it, and choose New Rule.
From the drop-down list, select Use a formula to determine which cells to format.
Type the following formula in the formula bar: =$C1="". Note: Replace C with the column that has the value you are inspecting, and 1 with the row that contains the active cell.
Choose the formatting style you want to apply to the hidden cells.
Click OK to apply the formatting rule.
This will hide the contents of the rows where the specified column is blank, but the rows will still be visible.
