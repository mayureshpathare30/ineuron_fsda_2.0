1. What do you mean by cells in an excel sheet?
In the context of Microsoft Excel, a cell is a rectangular-shaped box that is located at the intersection of a row and a column an Excel worksheet.
Cells are the basic building blocks of an Excel worksheet, and they are used to store and organize data in a spread.
Each cell has its own unique address, which is determined by its column and row location. For example, the cell that is located at the intersection of column C and row 5 would have a cell address of C5.
Excel allows users to enter various types of data into cells, including numeric, text, date, and time data.
Cells can also contain formulas and functions that can be used to perform calculations and analyze data.
